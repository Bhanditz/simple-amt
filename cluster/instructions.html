<h2>Detailed Instructions for "Which of These are Not Like the Others?"</h2>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>This task is inspired by the children's game "One of these things is not like the other".  If you are unfamiliar with this old game, here are a few classic examples:

<p>The puzzles might seem simple, but they capture a tricky pattern-matching concept that we would like to understand better.  The puzzles can have a lot of variety: in the first puzzle the kids need to identify that the pattern is about the same type of object (sunglasses); in the second, it is about a specific abstract shape (rectangles).  In the third, it is about color and texture (red, round and smooth). And the last one is about a category of objects made of the same warm material (knitted woolen fabric).

<h3>Our Task</h3>
<p>In our task, you will help us investigate patterns by playing a similar game. We will show you a grid of 20 pictures highlighting certain areas.  In the grid, most of the images will have something in common in those areas.  You need to figure out the pattern and find several pictures (at least three) that do not belong with the rest.  After you have found the ones that do not belong, you will explain what is in common among the pictures that you have kept.

<p>Here is an example game that is completed:
<center>
<img src="like-the-others-ex.png"
style="border:2px solid black; padding:10px; margin:10px">
</center>

<p>A few things are important to keep in mind.

<ul>
<li>You will <b>cross out at least three images that do not fit</b> the main pattern.  These misfits might or might not have anything in common among each other, but they do not fit with the pattern shared by the majority of the examples.  For example, here we have crossed out a picture with faces and also a few pictures showing exterior building parts.  If it is difficult to find three different ones, you need to choose at least the three of the least similar ones.  If many pictures that do not fit the pattern, you can cross out as many as you like. We have crossed out four here, and you are free to cross out more.
<li>You will select <b>what kind of pattern</b> it is. In this example, the pictures all show the same <u>part</u> of an object: an edge of a tabletop or countertop.  So we selected "part".  Other patterns might be whole objects, scenes made of multiple objects, abstract shapes, locations, textures, materials, or colors. These categories are discussed below.
<li>You will also <b>describe the pattern in detail</b>.  Here it wouldn't be right to say that the pattern is just "an edge" (too vague), or "a kitchen" (these areas do not show whole kitchen scenes).  We have written "an edge of a countertop or table" because, to us, that seems like the single specific and coherent concept shared by the highlighted areas. Describe the clearest, most coherent concept that you can see.
<li>Finally, you should <b>rate your confidence</b> in your solution. Some of the puzzles may be difficult, and this is your opportunity to tell us if you are unusure about your solution.
</ul>


<h3>Glossary</h3>
<p>You will be asked to choose the type of pattern from a list.  Here is our explanation of the different types of patterns.
<p>
<table class="table-condensed table-bordered">
<tr>
<td>object</td>
<td>A single kind of object such as "a car" or "a tree".  Describe any commonlity you notice: "a tree with no leaves", "a lit lamp", "a flying airplane", "a shirt with words."
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>part</td>
<td>A part of an object such as "a wheel of a car" or "the top of a window". Describe the part as well as what it is a part of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scene</td>
<td>An arrangement of several objects such as "a formal garden", "a crowd of people".  Note any special attributes of the scene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>location</td>
<td>A general location relative to something else: "space to the right of a person", "shadow underneath a train".  Describe where it is, and relative to what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>shape</td>
<td>An abstract shape such as "repeated horizontal white lines", or "the top-right corner of a dark square".  When describing a shape, note any common orientation, color, or size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>texture</td>
<td>Textural attributes "fluffy and light-colored"; "smooth, colorful and shiny."; "tangled and green."  When describing a texture, be sure to include any common attributes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>material</td>
<td>Things made of the same type of material "reddish rock"; "dark wood with vertical grain"; again, note any special attributes of the common material you notice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>color</td>
<td>Sometimes the main pattern is a color.  If the colors appear on the same type or size of thing, note it in the description: "yellow markings"; "small blue objects"; "dark shadow".</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Interface Tips</h3>

<p>The interface can be driven with the keyboard, the mouse, or both.  Here are some keyboard shortcuts.
<p>
<table class="table-condensed table-bordered">
<tr><td>Pagedown/pageup</td> <td>Next/previous puzzle</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tab/arrow</td> <td>Advance through the image images and inputs</td></tr>
<tr><td>X or space</td> <td>Cross out the selected image</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enter</td> <td>Finish the current input field</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shift-tab</td> <td>Go back to the previous input field</td></tr>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you shrink or grow your browser window, the images will resize.  Hovering the mouse over an image (or tabbing to it using the keyboard) will enlarge it to its full size.

<p>The filmstrip at the bottom summarizes your progress through all the puzzles, with green checkmarks showing finished work. You can go back to adjust your work at any time.

<p>Nothing is sumbitted until you press the green "Submit" button on the last page.

<p>Thank you for your help!
